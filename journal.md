### Initial Setup

> Commit capturing this state: [b368d40](https://github.com/watermanpdx/CS563-Final-Project/commit/b368d40)

The base repo was set up and initialized with an initial README.md, journal (this document), and "Hello World" index.html. At the time of this commit, no major content was added to index.html and no styling or javascript was included. The purpose of this initial update was to ensure the github repository index.html hosting was working as expected.

I decided to capure my journal as a markdown file similar to the README.md as it makes it easy to format, and deploy directly together with the code.

One challenge that I encountered was that I have a personal GitHub account that I use for personal projects. I ran into issues on my local machine trying to clarify which account I was using, and what credentials to use. I couldn't quite get my PDX credentials and account to work locally along with my personal account. Not wanting to disrupt my personal account, I chose instead to add my personal account [`TayticusPrime`](https://github.com/TayticusPrime) as a collaborator and author my changes from this account. **Note** changes to this repository will therefore show up from this account. Both accounts are owned by me, Tayte Waterman, and the work contained in this repo is soley my own.
