### Initial Setup

> Commit capturing this state: [b368d40](https://github.com/watermanpdx/CS563-Final-Project/commit/b368d40)

The base repo was set up and initialized with an initial README.md, journal (this document), and "Hello World" index.html. At the time of this commit, no major content was added to index.html and no styling or javascript was included. The purpose of this initial update was to ensure the github repository index.html hosting was working as expected.

I decided to capure my journal as a markdown file similar to the README.md as it makes it easy to format, and deploy directly together with the code.
